    <!-- project 1 -->
    <div class="proj1-container">
  <h3 class="proj1-title">Project 1: Digital Ghost</h3>
  <p class="proj1-description">My first foray into creative coding! I enjoyed the experience of "blindly" creating – typing out my code and only viewing the results after inputting all the details.</p>

  <!-- project 2 -->  
  <div class="proj2-container">
  <h3 class="proj2-title">Project 2: Lost Object</h3>
  <p class="proj2-description">I enjoyed manipulating circles for this project, as well as adding details to my second p5.js sketch, particularly elements of color. Correctly identifying coordinates of each detail was something that challenged me during the creation of this object.</p>

  <!-- project 3 -->  
  <div class="proj3-container">
  <h3 class="proj3-title">Project 3: Love Generator</h3>
  <p class="proj3-description">Perfectly timed with Valentine's Day, I created a random generator that changes the color of the hearts and text with each click of the mouse. I used bezier curves for the hearts which was hard but fun!</p>

  <!-- project 4 -->  
  <div class="proj4-container">
  <h3 class="proj4-title">Project 4: Memory Clock</h3>
  <p class="proj4-description">This "clock" works by showing a different memory from a very specific time on each click of the mouse. This is a way of tracking moments in time that have since slipped away. I used if / else statements in this project to determine when each image and corresponding time would be shown.</p>

  <!-- project 5 -->  
  <div class="proj5-container">
  <h3 class="proj5-title">Project 5: Hi Miss Monster!</h3>
  <p class="proj5-description">I had so much fun with this project – it was my first time working with SVG files and it was really cool to combine those with code! My favorite part of this sketch is the eyeball – it took some time to get the boinging movement just right, but turned out really successful.</p>

  <!-- project 6 -->  
  <div class="proj6-container">
  <h3 class="proj6-title">Project 6: Moiré Weaving</h3>
  <p class="proj6-description">For this project, I played with the moiré optical illusion to create a colorful loom. Loops were implemented to create the strands of "fabric".</p>

  <!-- project 7 -->  
  <div class="proj7-container">
  <h3 class="proj7-title">Project 7: A Week of Dancing to Songs</h3>
  <p class="proj7-description">This project utilized arrays to track shapes, movements, and colors, to music I listened to throughout a week. I'm quite pleased with how the colors and overlapping transparency worked out.</p>

      <!-- project 8 -->  
  <div class="proj8-container">
  <h3 class="proj8-title">Project 8: Sara Lost Her Glasses!</h3>
  <p class="proj8-description">My semester of creative coding culminated in a personal game that documents my experience with having poor eyesight. In the game, the player "finds" objects after breaking Sara's glasses. I used a combination of photo collage and illustration to replicate a unique experience.</p>
